# Motion craft: the production bar

Direct the video as a senior motion designer delivering a finished production
piece for a real launch, not a demo, prototype or template walkthrough. The
viewer should feel the motion before they read the words. Style profiles decide
*which* moves are allowed; this file decides *how well* they are executed.
Everything here runs inside `composition-contract.md` (paused timeline, TIMING,
seeded randomness) and the base profile's constraints.

## Scale the juice to the style

Juice is the amount of anticipation, overshoot, impact and secondary motion.
Read the base profile's `energy` and its `constraints` first; a constraint such
as "no shake" or "every tween eased, no bounce" always wins.

| Energy | Juice budget |
|---|---|
| 1–2 (cinematic, calm, premium) | No shake, bounce or elastic. The juice comes from exquisite easing, overlap, parallax depth, light sweeps, match-moves and held stillness. |
| 3 (product, editorial) | Soft overshoot (`back.out(1.4)`), smears on UI, one impact per section on a drop (`slam(el, t, { soft: true })`, flash without shake). |
| 4–5 (comic, sport, hype) | Full vocabulary: slams, squash and stretch, shake, smear frames, impact frames, particle bursts on kicks. |

## Principles every scene obeys

1. **One focal point per moment.** Decide where the eye goes on every beat and
   move only what serves it; everything else holds or drifts.
2. **No dead frames.** A hold is at least one beat of stillness for reading,
   carried by micro-motion: `settleCam` push-in (1.00 → 1.03–1.05), a slow
   parallax drift or a light sweep. Nothing on screen is ever fully frozen.
3. **Overlap, never queue.** The next action starts while the previous one is
   still settling, 30–60% into it. Staggers use an eased distribution
   (`stagger: { each: 0.05, from: "center", ease: "power1.in" }`), never
   uniform 0.1 s steps.
4. **Anticipation → action → follow-through.** Big moves wind up 2–4 frames the
   other way, overshoot, then settle. Secondary parts (shadows, labels, icons,
   underlines) arrive 2–4 frames after the primary part and settle later.
5. **Designed easing.** Entrances `expo.out` or `power4.out` (fast, then a long
   settle); camera and layout moves `power3.inOut` or `expo.inOut`; exits are
   ~60% of the entrance duration with an `.in` ease. Never `linear` (except
   opacity holds and `settleCam`), and never the default `power1`.
6. **Arcs, not rails.** Moving objects travel on curves: tween `x` and `y` with
   different eases (`x: expo.out`, `y: power2.inOut`), or add a small rotation
   that resolves on landing.
7. **Continuity across cuts.** A scene hands off to the next one: a shape grows
   into the next background, the hero shrinks into its slot (match-move), or
   motion keeps its direction through a whip. A fade to nothing and a rebuild
   is the fallback, not the default.
8. **Depth.** At least three layers: background (slowest, may be blurred and
   baked), midground content, and a foreground accent (particles, a bokeh or
   glass shape, a frame edge) moving fastest. Parallax ratio ≈ 0.3 : 1 : 1.6.
9. **Rhythm is edited.** Big moves land on downbeats and `TIMING.drops`, reveals
   on the spoken keyword (`W(sid, word)`), micro accents on off-beats. Vary the
   density: calm set-up → build → drop → breathe. Three equal-energy scenes in a
   row read as a template.
10. **Readable.** Text holds at least 0.4 s + 0.06 s per word after it settles.
    Motion never runs behind a line while it is being read.

## Technique cookbook

The skeleton ships `slam`, `smear`, `lineIn`, `settleCam` and `shake` next to
`pop`, `rise` and `draw`. Build the rest from GSAP on the one timeline.

| Technique | Recipe | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| Slam / impact | `slam(el, W(sid, "word"))`: lands oversized and blurred on the word onset, squashes 3 frames, elastic settle | hero numbers, titles on a drop |
| Squash and stretch | on landing `scaleX: 1.08, scaleY: 0.9` for 2–3 frames, then `elastic.out(1, 0.5)`; keep volume (x × y ≈ 1) | mascots, badges, icons |
| Smear frame | `smear(el, t, { dx: -300 })`: skew in the travel direction and settle to 0; for a longer blur add 2–3 ghost copies (`.ghost`) at 0.35/0.2/0.1 opacity trailing by 1 frame each | fast lateral entrances, whip transitions |
| Masked line reveal | wrap each line in `overflow: hidden`, then `lineIn(words, t)`: words rise from below the mask with a slight rotation that resolves | headlines, kinetic type |
| Kinetic keyword | the spoken keyword scales 1 → 1.12 → 1 on its onset, turns accent colour, tracking tightens from 0.04em to -0.02em | emphasis inside a sentence |
| Whip pan | outgoing stage `x: -W, skewX: 12` over 0.22 s `expo.in`, incoming from `+W` with `expo.out`, on a beat; add a 1-frame speed-line layer | energetic scene changes |
| Zoom-through | current scene scales 1 → 2.4 with opacity to 0 over 0.3 s `expo.in` while the next scales 0.85 → 1 | reveal of a detail or product |
| Shape wipe | an accent block sweeps across (`scaleX` 0 → 1 from the left, then 1 → 0 to the right) and the scene swaps under it at the midpoint | clean branded transitions |
| Iris / clip reveal | `clipPath: circle(0% at x y)` → `circle(150% ...)` on `expo.inOut` (count toward the clip-path budget) | focus on a UI element |
| Camera push and rack focus | wrap a scene in a camera group; `settleCam` during holds; rack focus by swapping `filter: blur()` between two baked layers over 0.4 s | premium holds, depth |
| Impact frame | 1 frame of `#flash` at 0.6–0.9, then `shake` decaying over 6 frames, optional 2-frame RGB split | drops, big reveals (energy ≥ 4) |
| Light sweep | a skewed white gradient bar crosses a card inside its mask over 0.6 s `power2.inOut`, opacity ≤ 0.35 | premium cards, product glints |
| Particle burst | 8–16 prebuilt dots, seeded `rng` angles and distances, `expo.out` outward, fade late, slight gravity on `y` | clicks, unlocks, achievements |
| Counter | `odo` with `power3.out` so it decelerates into the value, then a 1.06 bump and an accent flash on the final digit | stats |
| Chart growth | bars grow with `back.out(1.3)`, staggered from the tallest; lines `draw` with a leading dot riding the path | data scenes |
| UI choreography | cursor travels on an arc and decelerates, a press is `scale: 0.96` for 3 frames plus a ripple, panels cascade with overlap, then the result lands with a soft overshoot | product demos |

Rules for the cookbook:
- Heavy effects (`filter`, `clip-path`, big gradients) follow the renderer
  limits: attach them only while they run and set them back to `none`.
- Ghosts, particles and wipe layers exist in the DOM before the first tween;
  only their tweens are scheduled.
- A technique that the base profile's `avoid` or `constraints` rule out is not
  used, even when it would add juice. When the profile gives its own values for
  a technique (a zoom scale, a wipe direction), use the profile's values.
- Line masks, reels and sweep masks carry `data-layout-allow-overflow`, or
  `check` reports their clipping as an error.

## Replace demo tells with production choices

| Demo tell | Production choice |
|---|---|
| Everything fades in with opacity only | Each element has an entrance verb: rise out of a mask, slam, smear, draw, grow from its anchor |
| Same duration and ease everywhere | Durations vary with mass and distance; small UI parts are faster than big panels |
| All elements start together | Choreographed overlap with a clear lead element |
| Centred text on a flat background, scene after scene | Framed compositions: asymmetric layouts, scale contrast, depth layers, product UI in context |
| Every scene built the same way | Each scene type has its own choreography; recurring types follow the reference demo |
| Hard cut, then rebuild from empty | Transitions that carry motion, shape or colour into the next scene |
| Motion stops dead at the end of a tween | Overshoot and settle, then micro-motion until the exit |
| Placeholder copy, default borders, stock gradients | Real facts, designed components, baked textures |

## Director's pass (per scene, before rendering)

Check each scene against this list and fix what fails:
- The focal point on every beat is obvious, and the hero moment lands on the
  spoken keyword or a drop.
- There are three depth layers, and at least one element keeps moving during holds.
- Every entrance has anticipation or a mask, and every landing has follow-through.
- The exit hands off to the next scene (match-move, whip, wipe or zoom-through).
- Text is readable for its full hold; captions and the signature are untouched.
- The juice level matches the base profile's energy and constraints.

## Reviewing motion cheaply

Stills hide motion problems, and watching full renders costs time and context.
Render one draft and read each scene as a contact sheet (one small image per
scene, 18 frames spread evenly across the whole scene):

```bash
npx --yes hyperframes@0.8.77 render -q draft -o renders/draft.mp4
ffmpeg -v error -y -ss <scene start> -t <scene length> -i renders/draft.mp4 \
  -vf "fps=18/<scene length>,scale=320:-1,tile=6x3" -frames:v 1 renders/sheet-<sid>.jpg
```

The sheet covers the entrance, the holds, the exit and the handoff, and shows
whether moves overlap, overshoot and settle, and whether any stretch is dead.
For a fast entrance, add a second sheet of its first second at `fps=18`. Look at the sheet, fix, and re-render only when the
choreography changed.
